## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip3
- Google account with Gmail, Google Tasks, and Google Calendar access
- OpenAI API key (for AI-powered classification and task generation)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd emailToTaskDev
   ```

2. **Make the setup script executable and run it**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The setup script will:
   - Install all Python dependencies
   - Guide you through Google OAuth setup
   - Create environment variables

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   python3 server/app.py
   ```
   
   Or use npm scripts:
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Runs both frontend and backend
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`

## 🔧 Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup or the script doesn't work:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd server
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

### 2. Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Gmail API
   - Google Tasks API
   - Google Calendar API
4. Go to "Credentials" and create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Set application type to "Web application"
6. Add `http://localhost:5173/oauth2callback` to authorized redirect URIs (this goes through the Vite proxy)
7. Download the JSON file and save it as `client_secret.json` in the project root

### 3. OpenAI API Setup

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key (you won't be able to see it again)

### 5. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=development

# Google OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRETS=client_secret.json
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5001/oauth2callback

# Task Provider Configuration
DEFAULT_TASK_PROVIDER=google_tasks
TASKS_LIST_TITLE=Email Tasks

# OpenAI Configuration for ML Classification
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Application Configuration
PORT=5001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

   ```

3. **Configure OAuth Redirect URI**:
   - Add your production redirect URI to Google Cloud Console OAuth credentials:
     `https://your-cloud-run-url/oauth2callback`

4. **Deploy**:

   # Or deploy separately
   npm run deploy:client 
   npm run deploy:server

   - Secrets (`FLASK_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are managed via Google Cloud Secret Manager
   - Other environment variables are set in `cloudbuild.yaml`

## 🤖 AI Classification Features

The application uses OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently process emails:

### Email Classification
The AI automatically determines whether an email should become a task based on:
- **Action items or requests** → Creates task
- **Reminders or deadlines** → Creates task
- **Meeting invitations** → Creates task + calendar event
- **Bills or payments** → Creates task
- **Pure newsletters** → Skips
- **Marketing content** → Skips
- **Social media notifications** → Skips
- **FYI-only messages** → Skips

### Meeting Detection
The AI automatically detects meeting invitations and:
- Creates a Google Calendar event with the meeting details
- Extracts meeting time, location, and participants
- Links the calendar event to the original email

### Task Generation
For emails classified as tasks, the AI:
- **Generates concise titles**: Actionable, 3-8 words, removing prefixes like "RE:", "FWD:"
- **Creates clean descriptions**: Extracts key details, dates, and requirements
- **Handles HTML content**: Automatically converts HTML emails to clean plain text
- **Provides reasoning**: Logs why decisions were made (visible in console)

### Fallback Behavior
If OpenAI API is unavailable or not configured:
- All emails are processed as tasks (default behavior)
- Original email subject becomes task title
- Original email body becomes task description
